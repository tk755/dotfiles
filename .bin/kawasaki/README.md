# `~/bin/kawasaki`

This directory contains various scripts specific to my machine called `kawasaki` - which is an early 2015 13-inch Apple MacBookPro.

## First time setup

The directory `setup` contains scripts that need to be copied into the filesystem of the machine one time. Run `setup.sh` to automatically copy those scripts to their designated locations.
